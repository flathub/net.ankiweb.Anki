  <description>
    <p>Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.</p>
    <p>Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.</p>
    <p>Optional LaTeX support is provided by the TeX Live Flatpak extension org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive//22.08.</p>

    <release date="2022-06-24" version="2.1.54">
      <description>
        <p>If updating from Anki 2.1.49 or below, please see the 2.1.50 change notes first.</p>
        <p>A new CSV importer &amp; exporter, thanks to Rumo:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shows a preview based on the selected field separator.</li>
          <li>Column mapping includes field text for reference.</li>
          <li>Multiple decks and notetypes can now be imported/exported at once, as columns can be mapped to deck or notetype name.</li>
          <li>Supports exporting and importing a unique identifier for a note, to use instead of a matching first field. This removes the need for the 'add note id' add-on.</li>
          <li>Extends the header syntax so that files can specify metadata such as the desired field separator, and the mapping of fields.</li>
          <li>The new functionality is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with a checkbox in the preferences screen. This also enables the new apkg import/export code introduced in 2.1.52. If you use the Special Fields add-on, you will need to disable this option in order to use the add-on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Update to Qt 6.3.1:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixes complex-language input (eg Japanese, Hindi, etc) on macOS being flaky.</li>
          <li>Fixes unwanted text when copying from the review screen on Windows.</li>
          <li>Fixes a startup failure with certain Linux keyboard configurations.</li>

          <li>Editor API improvements (thanks to Henrik).</li>
          <li>Field descriptions in the editor are now shown inline, instead of in a tooltip (thanks to Matthias, Henrik and Hikaru).</li>
          <li>Fixed a rounding issue when describing time intervals of a year or more.</li>
          <li>Fixed an error that occurred after a one-way download fetched a collection with a different scheduler version enabled.</li>
          <li>Fixed desktop hanging when attempting to add a new notetype in KDE (kwin).</li>
          <li>Fixed flag names not updating after sync until Anki restarted.</li>
          <li>Fixed inability to enter underscore in tags area on some keyboard layouts (thanks to Henrik).</li>
          <li>Fixed undo history being cleared and error showing when double-tapping delete in Browse screen.</li>
          <li>Provide a way for the review screen to support drop events (thanks to Abdo).</li>

        <p>Editor Improvements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rework image resizing (thanks to Henrik). Images expand to the editor width by default now, and images that are resized for the editor will remain that way if you switch fields, or navigate to a different note and back.</li>
          <li>Existing height constraints on images are stripped when resizing (thanks to BlueGreenMagick).</li>
          <li>The MathJax editor now provides buttons/shortcuts to cloze-delete selected text (thanks to Henrik).</li>

          <li>The Qt5 Mac build now caps tag autocomplete matches to 10, as showing more is extremely slow in the old toolkit version.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other Improvements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Update Qt to 6.3.0, which fixes slow loading of large images, and inertial scrolling on macOS.</li>

          <li>Reset page zoom when moving between different screens.</li>
          <li>The Qt6 Linux build now defaults to X11/XWayland instead of Wayland due to some remaining issues; you can force-enable Wayland with ANKI_WAYLAND=1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For Developers</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The field_filter hook can now check if it's running for the question or answer side (thanks to Abdo).</li>

        <p>New Apkg Import/Export</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Undo/redo is now supported.</li>
          <li>Faster imports (especially for decks with a lot of note content).</li>
          <li>Support for older clients can be optionally disabled, which results in smaller apkg files, and faster imports.</li>
          <li>Flags are removed when scheduling is excluded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The new functionality is hidden behind a feature flag, and not active by default. You can try it out by using mw.pm.set_new_import_export(True) in the debug console. To revert to the old behaviour, replace True with False.</p>
        <p>Things to note:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is new code that has received limited testing so far, so please use File&gt;Create Backup before trying it out. Any testing/feedback you can provide would be appreciated.</li>
          <li>While active, it is not currently possible to import/export files other than apkg/colpkg.</li>
          <li>The Special Fields add-on will not work while this functionality is enabled.</li>

          <li>The Linux builds need zstd to decompress.</li>
          <li>The packaged version requires glibc 2.27 or later.</li>
          <li>A wheel is now provided for ARM64 Linux, and requires glibc 2.31 or greater.</li>
          <li>Both Fcitx4 and Fcitx5 support is now bundled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Qt6</p>
        <p>The packaged builds now come in separate Qt5 and Qt6 versions. Each version has some advantages and disadvantages. The Flatpak build will use Qt5 for now.</p>
        <p>Scheduler Changes</p>
        <p>The V1 scheduler is no longer supported. If you have not yet updated to V2 or V3, you will be prompted to update when you attempt to review cards in 2.1.50.</p>
        <p>This release includes a number of improvements to the V3 scheduler, mostly thanks to Rumo:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Intermediate deck limits now affect their children. Please see the scheduler page for more info.</li>
          <li>When new cards are answered, Anki now records their original position. When you later export a shared deck without scheduling, the original positions will be restored.</li>
          <li>The Forget action now gives you options to restore the original card position, and to reset the card's lapse and repetition counters.</li>
          <li>The gathering and sorting of new cards has been reworked, trading a little performance for more intuitive behaviour:
            <ul>
              <li>It is now possible to sort notes or cards randomly at gather time, ensuring a random selection is taken from all available new cards.</li>
              <li>The gather order and sort order options have been simplified, but should offer the same functionality as before. Please check your deck options after upgrading, as some users may need to adjust their display order settings to match what they were using before.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The overview screen now shows how many cards will be buried.</li>
          <li>Added a separate option to control burying of interday learning siblings.</li>
          <li>Fixed interday learning siblings not being buried during review, causing them to reappear later after actions like an edit.</li>
          <li>If you have more than 2 learning steps, after the first step, Hard repeats the previous delay, instead of being the average of the previous and next step.</li>
          <li>When a Hard learning step exceeds a day, it is now rounded to a full day, so the delay does not vary depending on the time of day you answer.</li>
          <li>Fuzz is applied more evenly now, especially with smaller intervals.</li>
          <li>Fixed new cards not decrementing the review limit, which could lead to more new cards appearing after the review limit was reached.</li>
          <li>Review cards and new cards are now interspersed more evenly.</li>
          <li>When using Custom Study to extend deck limits in the V3 scheduler, parent/child limits of the selected deck are no longer adjusted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Editor Changes</p>
        <p>Most of these changes are thanks to Henrik.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A redesigned editing area, and a redesigned tag editor.</li>
          <li>MathJax has a live preview.</li>
          <li>HTML source and rendered text can be viewed at the same time.</li>
          <li>The HTML editor now matches the current Anki theme.</li>
          <li>Images can be resized within the editor.</li>
          <li>Fields can now have an optional description/tooltip assigned to them (thanks to Matthias, Henrik &amp; Rumo).</li>
          <li>The "remove formatting" button now offers a choice of what to remove.</li>
          <li>Adjust color picker shortcut, and apply color when different color selected.</li>
          <li>Reduced editor button size on Windows/Linux (thanks to Matthias).</li>
          <li>Fixed IME input after pressing tab.</li>
          <li>Fixed media files not being inserted at cursor position on Windows.</li>
          <li>Cloze shortcut correctly positions cursor.</li>
          <li>Added a separate cloze button to repeat the current cloze.</li>
          <li>Lots of behind-the-scenes changes and fixes. Because of the extensive changes, some add-ons that modify the editing screen will have broken.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>New Features</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Anki will now switch to day or night mode automatically depending on your system settings. You can force day or night mode in the Preferences screen. (thanks in large part to Rumo).</li>
          <li>Reworked backup handling (mostly thanks to Rumo):
            <ul>
              <li>Backups are created much faster than they were previously.</li>
              <li>Anki can now create backups periodically. The default is every 30 minutes; you can adjust this in the preferences screen.</li>
              <li>There are new options in the preferences to control the number of daily, weekly and monthly backups you'd like to retain.</li>
              <li>The File menu now has an option to create a backup immediately.</li>
              <li>Because the backup storage format has changed, backups created with 2.1.50 will not be importable into older Anki versions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Reworked .colpkg import/export (thanks to Rumo):
            <ul>
              <li>When exporting, you can optionally target Anki 2.1.50+. When doing so, imports and exports are faster, and media files will be compressed, but the resulting .colpkg will not be readable by older Anki clients.</li>
              <li>Collections are now checked for corruption when importing.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>An option to ignore accents in searches by default has been added to preferences screen (thanks to Abdo).</li>
          <li>The Card Info screen now updates automatically as you change to a different card (thanks to Rumo).</li>
          <li>Added a View menu to the main window and browse window (thanks to Rumo). The view menu provides options to zoom in and out, and to toggle a full screen mode. Due to technical issues, the full screen mode is not currently available on Windows when graphics acceleration is enabled.</li>
          <li>A new TTS tag format that allows you to combine extra text and multiple fields, such as [anki:tts lang=en_US]Here is {{Field1}} and {{Field2}}[/anki:tts] (thanks to Rumo). There are no plans to deprecate the old TTS syntax - either can be used.</li>
          <li>Added an option to add/remove sidebar tag to selected notes (thanks to Rumo).</li>
          <li>Be smarter about mapping existing text to new fields when switching notetypes in the Add screen (thanks to Abdo).</li>
          <li>Apkg files can now be dragged on the main window to import them (thanks to Abdo).</li>
          <li>Added a "Create Copy" option in the browse screen and review screen, to copy selected note's contents into the Add window (thanks to Rumo).</li>
          <li>You can now search for tags by regular expression (thanks to Rumo). One use for this is locating notes that are tagged with a parent tag, while not matching ones tagged with parent::child: tag:re:^parent$.</li>
          <li>When switching Anki versions, an add-on update check is run on startup (thanks to Rumo).</li>
          <li>Make links with target=_blank work (thanks to Danish).</li>
          <li>Added "Forget Card" action to review screen (thanks to Araceli).</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Fix a bug in Anki 2.1.28+ where a newly created deck config would default to an ease of 130%. When updating, Anki will automatically change any deck configs with an ease of 130% back to 250%, and change any cards using those deck configs with a low ease back to an ease of 250%. (cont.)</li>
          <li>(cont.) Users who updated from an older Anki version and did not add new deck configurations should not be affected. If you have deliberately set an initial ease of 130%, please change it to 131% or greater prior to upgrading, so that Anki leaves your settings alone. Thanks to Aleksa for discovering the issue.</li>
          <li>Update the standard builds to the latest GUI toolkit version. Please report any improvements or regressions you notice.</li>
          <li>Dropped audio plays automatically again (thanks to abdo).</li>
          <li>Revert to older sound playing behaviour to work around issues (thanks to kelciour).</li>
