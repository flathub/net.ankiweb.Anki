Try running the app as follows: <code>flatpak run --env=QT_SCALE_FACTOR_ROUNDING_POLICY=passthrough net.ankiweb.Anki</code>. If scaling works properly, add an override with <code>flatpak override --env=QT_SCALE_FACTOR_ROUNDING_POLICY=passthrough net.ankiweb.Anki</code> or with Flatseal.

<summary>MPV: How to disable (due to graphics problems, high cpu, or other reasons)</summary>
MPV is bundled with the app, but some people want to disable this due to issues with mpv (not the anki app). Here is how:

<ol>
<li>Find the addon directory (usually <code>.var/app/net.ankiweb.Anki/data/Anki2/addons</code>), <code>cd</code> to it.</li>
<li><code>mkdir nompv</code>, then <code>cd nompv</code></li>
<li>Add the contents of the following to  <code>__init.py__</code>: https://gist.github.com/rayes0/5fd3a629011846bd17d93fa9276080c7
</li>

This will stop mpv's idle process in anki and replace it with a dummy player. Audio and video will no longer work.
